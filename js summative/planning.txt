pseudocode notes
<!-- store flashcards in a single 2 dimensional js array, in which each embedded array contains a question, the answer, and then 3 false options
Create a span that dynamically change the card
When an arrow is used, change the current index and call a updatecard(), which checks both the flip and index to display the correct information
after the code initialises, split the first and second index of teh two dimensional array into a term and definition array
when the flashcard itself is clicked, ++ a variable, and then take the %2 to determine whether to use the term or definition array-->


<!--
Flagging questions for review
When flag button is pressed:
Add index to a list
If already in list remove index


When test is pressed:
